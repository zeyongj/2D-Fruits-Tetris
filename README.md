# 2D Fruits Tetris

## Introduction
- SFU CMPT 361: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Individual Project: 2D Fruit Tetris via C++ and OpenGL.
- This project is to implement a simple interactive game that combines some features
  from Tetris and some from Falling Fruits.
- Following the path, first I set default falling time and number of colors.
- I create the 5 colors representing 5 kinds of fruits. And also, I create matrices of the different shapes of I, S and L.
- I check whether the stack-up occurs, and determine whether the game need too stop or not.
- I also consider the problem of key stroke interaction, tile movements and colliding.
- I try to satisfy the addtional game logic and the certain press operations.
- I set the executable as "FruitTetris" as the requirement in the instruction.

## Execution

- Compile: `make`.
- Run: `./FruitTetris3D`.

It is expected that within this course, the highest standards of academic integrity will be maintained, in
keeping with SFU’s Policy S10.01, `Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct`.

In this class, collaboration is encouraged for in-class exercises and the team components of the assignments, as well
as task preparation for group discussions. However, individual work should be completed by the person
who submits it. Any work that is independent work of the submitter should be clearly cited to make its
source clear. All referenced work in reports and presentations must be appropriately cited, to include
websites, as well as figures and graphs in presentations. If there are any questions whatsoever, feel free
to contact the course instructor about any possible grey areas.

Some examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- Handing in assignments/exercises that are not 100% your own work (in design, implementation,
wording, etc.), without a clear/visible citation of the source.
- Using another student's work as a template or reference for completing your own work.
- Using any unpermitted resources during an exam.
- Looking at, or attempting to look at, another student's answer during an exam.
- Submitting work that has been submitted before, for any course at any institution.

All instances of academic dishonesty will be dealt with severely and according to SFU policy. This means
that Student Services will be notified, and they will record the dishonesty in the student's file. Students
are strongly encouraged to review SFU’s Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct (S10.01) available
